# GitHub PR Language Stats

A Chrome extension that shows line count statistics by programming language for GitHub pull requests.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Language Breakdown**: See exactly how many lines were added/removed per programming language
- ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate Detection**: Uses file extensions to identify languages
- ðŸŽ¨ **GitHub Native Design**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub's UI
- ðŸŒ™ **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to your GitHub theme

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd github-linecount
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `github-linecount` directory

5. The extension is now installed! Visit any GitHub pull request to see it in action.

### From Chrome Web Store

*Coming soon!*

## Usage

1. Navigate to any GitHub pull request
2. The language statistics panel will automatically appear below the PR header
3. View the breakdown of added/removed lines by language

The extension shows:
- Language name
- Number of files per language
- Lines added (+) per language
- Lines removed (-) per language
- Percentage of total changes

## How It Works

The extension:
1. Detects when you're viewing a GitHub pull request
2. Analyzes the diff view to extract file changes
3. Identifies the programming language from file extensions
4. Calculates line counts (added/removed) per language
5. Displays a summary table in the PR interface

## Supported Languages

The extension detects 40+ programming languages including:
- **Web**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Vue, React (JSX/TSX)
- **Backend**: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, C#
- **Data**: JSON, YAML, SQL, XML
- **Markup**: Markdown, reStructuredText
- And many more!

## Privacy

This extension:
- âœ… Only runs on GitHub.com
- âœ… Analyzes data locally in your browser
- âœ… Does not collect or transmit any data
- âœ… Does not require authentication
- âœ… Open source for transparency

3. Click the refresh icon on the extension card
4. Refresh the GitHub PR page to see changes

### Testing

Run automated E2E tests with screenshots:

```bash
npm install           # Install dependencies (first time only)
npm run test:e2e      # Run E2E tests with Puppeteer
```

The tests will:
- Launch Chrome with the extension loaded
- Navigate to a real GitHub PR
- Take screenshots documenting the extension behavior
- Verify the language stats panel appears correctly

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed testing documentation.
