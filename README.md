# GitHub PR Polyglot Line Counts

A Chrome extension that shows line count statistics by programming language for GitHub pull requests - see exactly what languages changed and how long the review will take.

![Language Statistics Panel](tests/screenshots/03-panel-closeup.png)

## What It Does

Like "Better Line Counts" but shows **which languages** changed, not just totals.

## Features

- üìä **Language Breakdown**: See exactly how many lines were added/removed per programming language
- üìù **Review Time Estimate**: Calculates estimated review time based on language complexity
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Exclude Generated**: Toggle to filter out generated files
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Uses GitHub API for instant results
- üé® **GitHub Native Design**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub's UI

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd github-linecount
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `github-linecount` directory

5. The extension is now installed! Visit any GitHub pull request to see it in action.

### From Chrome Web Store

*Coming soon!*

## Usage

1. Navigate to any GitHub pull request
2. The language statistics panel will automatically appear below the PR header
3. View the breakdown of added/removed lines by language

The extension shows:
- Language name
- Number of files per language
- Lines added (+) per language
- Lines removed (-) per language
- Percentage of total changes

## How It Works

The extension:
1. Detects when you're viewing a GitHub pull request  
2. Fetches file data from GitHub API
3. Groups changes by programming language
4. Displays a summary table in the PR interface

Supports 40+ programming languages via file extension mapping.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by [Better Line Counts](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/github-better-line-counts/ocfdgncpifmegplaglcnglhioflaimkd) - which filters generated files from PR totals. We wanted the same accuracy, but broken down **by language** to understand what actually changed.
