# Testing Summary

## ✅ What Works

### Unit Tests (Fast & Reliable)
```bash
npm run test
```

**All 12 tests pass!** Validates:
- ✅ Language detection from file extensions (40+ languages)
- ✅ Stats calculation logic matches GitHub API exactly
- ✅ Rust: 6 files, +870 -216
- ✅ Markdown: 2 files, +1422 -0
- ✅ **Total: +2292 -216 (8 files) - 100% accurate!**

### E2E Tests with Screenshots
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

- ✅ Launches Chrome with extension loaded
- ✅ Navigates to GitHub PR
- ✅ Takes 5 screenshots documenting behavior
- ✅ Validates panel appears
- ⚠️  Currently finds only partial file list from DOM

## 🐛 Known Issue

**Problem**: Browser extension scrapes incomplete file list from GitHub DOM

- **Expected**: 8 files (+2292 -216)
- **Actual**: ~2-5 files (+411 -29)
- **Root Cause**: DOM selectors not capturing all file entries
- **Logic Status**: ✅ Proven correct by unit tests
- **Next Step**: Fix DOM scraping to find all files

## Test Architecture

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
- Tests pure logic without browser
- Uses GitHub API as ground truth
- Fast (<1 second)
- 100% reliable

### E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
- Tests full browser integration
- Uses Puppeteer with real Chrome
- Captures screenshots
- Validates end-to-end behavior

### Shared Library (`lib/`)
- `language-detector.js` - Source of truth for language logic
- Used by both tests and extension
- Proven accurate against GitHub API
