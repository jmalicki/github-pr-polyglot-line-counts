# 💡 Cool Feature Ideas Beyond Line Counts

Since we have a foothold in GitHub PRs, here are innovative features we could add:

## 🎯 PR Review Enhancement Features

### 1. **PR Complexity Score**
```
Calculates a "review complexity" score:
- Files changed × avg complexity
- Number of large files (>500 lines)
- Test coverage ratio
- Documentation changes included?

Shows: "⚠️ High Complexity: 8.5/10 - Budget extra review time"
```
**Value**: Help reviewers estimate time needed

### 2. **Smart File Grouping**
```
Groups files by logical area:
📦 Dependencies (package.json, Cargo.toml)
🧪 Tests (/test/, .spec., .test.)
📚 Docs (README, .md, /docs/)
⚙️ Config (.yml, .env, .config)
💻 Source (everything else)

Click to collapse/expand groups
```
**Value**: Navigate large PRs easily

### 3. **Estimated Review Time**
```
Based on research:
- ~200 lines/minute for review
- +50% for complex code (Rust, C++)
- +100% for architecture changes

Shows: "📝 Est. Review Time: 25-35 minutes"
```
**Value**: Time management

### 4. **Change Risk Indicator**
```
Flags potentially risky changes:
🔴 Database migrations
🔴 Authentication/security code
🟡 API contract changes
